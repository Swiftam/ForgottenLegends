Run Runaway~
I like black and white, dream in black in white
You like black and white, run runaway
See chameleon lying there in the sun
All things to everyone, run runaway
If your in the swing, money ain't everything
If your in the swing, run runaway
See chameleon lying there in the sun
All things to everyone, run runaway
If you got it sussed, don't beat around the bush
If you got it sussed, run runaway
See chameleon lying there in the sun
All things to everyone, run runaway
Oh now can't she wait?
No no come on and wait
Aw now can't she wait?  Run runaway!
See chameleon lying there in the sun
All things to everyone, run runaway
I like black and white, dream in black in white
You like black and white, run runaway
See chameleon lying there in the sun

Consequence Free~
Wouldn't it be great if no one ever got offended?
And wouldn't it be great to say what's really on your mind?
I've always said all the rules are made for bending,
And if I let my hair down, would that be such a crime?
I want to be consequence free
I want to be where nothing needs to matter
I want to be consequence free
Just say na na na na na na na-ah na
I said, na na na na na na na-ah na
I could really use to lose my Catholic conscience
'Cause I'm getting sick of feeling guilty all the time
And I want to lose it, yeah, I've got the best intentions,
For a little bit of anarchy, but not the hurting kind
I want to be consequence free
I want to be where nothing needs to matter
I want to be consequence free
Just say na na na na na na na-ah na
Oh na na na na na na na-ah na
I couldn't sleep at all last night
'Cause I had so much on my mind
And I'd like to leave it all behind
But you know it's not that easy,
Oh but just one night!
Wouldn't it be great if the band just never ended?
We could stay out late, and we would never hear last call
We wouldn't need to worry about approval or permission, we could
Slip off the edge, and never worry about the fall
I want to be consequence free
I want to be where nothing needs to matter
I want to be consequence free
Just say na na na na na na na-ah na
I said, na na na na na na na-ah na
One more, na na na na na na na-ah na

Time Brings~
Hearken to me both high and low
I'll sing for you a song
Of Kings and Queens, and rose-lipped maidens
Courting light foot lads
Now love is grand, when love is new
The heart blood, it runs strong
There's nothing a doting lad won't do
To keep his princess warm
He'll tease her with poems and promises
He'll ask her out to dance
He'll cajole and he'll beg
And he'll always win
In bitter-sweet romance
For time it comes, and time it goes
It makes the strongest tree to bend
Kings and Queens have no defence
Time brings all things to an end.
But he goes out, with his drinking pals
His eyes begin to roam
He forgets all about the brown-eyed beauty
Who now, sits home alone
There's no more walks, down lover's lane
There's no more wine in the sun
All that's left is a hollow pain
Time, alas you've won
For time it comes, and time it goes
It makes the strongest tree to bend
Kings and Queens have no defence
Time brings all things to an end.
Now all who wish for love to stay
And last your whole life through
Keep ahead of time me boys
And never be untrue
For time it comes, and time it goes
It makes the strongest tree to bend
Kings and Queens have no defence
Time brings all things to an end.

Berry Picking Time~
Well I spied a berry bush as I was strolling home one day
And somehow it brought back the bygone days
Of when you and I were berry picking many years ago
In a little county not so far away
How well I do remember the day when we first met
It leaves a picture in my mind I never can forget
We were picking berries at Old Aunt Mary's
When I picked a blushing bride
As we strolled home together, I just wondered whether
I could win you forever if I tried
Then at love's suggestion, I popped the question
And asked you to be mine
By your kisses I knew, you'd picked me and I'd picked you
At berry picking time
We were picking berries at Old Aunt Mary's
When I picked a blushing bride
As we strolled home together, I just wondered whether
I could win you forever if I tried
Then at love's suggestion, I popped the question
And asked you to be mine
By your kisses I knew, you'd picked me and I'd picked you
At berry picking time
Well how sweet you were that day, in your simple gingham gown
To me you were as lovely as a Queen
When from underneath your bonnet popped a pair of golden curls
And the bluest eyes that I have ever seen
Your lips were red as cherries, the taste was twice as sweet
It only took one kiss to make my happiness complete
We were picking berries at Old Aunt Mary's
When I picked a blushing bride
As we strolled home together, I just wondered whether
I could win you forever if I tried
Then at love's suggestion, I popped the question
And asked you to be mine
By your kisses I knew, you'd picked me and I'd picked you
At berry picking time

Mari-Mac~
There's a neat little lass and her name is Mari Mac
Make no mistake, she's the girl I'm gonna track
Lot of other fellas try to get her on her back
But I'm thinking that they'll have to get up early
Mari Mac's mother's making Mari Mac marry me
My mother's making me marry Mari Mac
Well I'm going to marry Mari for when Mari's taking care of me
We'll all be feeling merry when I marry Mari Mac
Now Mari and her mother are an awful lot together
In fact you hardly see the one without the other
And people often wonder if it's Mari or her mother
Or both of them together I am courting
Mari Mac's mother's making Mari Mac marry me
My mother's making me marry Mari Mac
Well I'm going to marry Mari for when Mari's taking care of me
We'll all be feeling merry when I marry Mari Mac
Well up among the heather in the hills of Bonifee
Well I had a bonnie lass sitting on me knee
A bumble bee stung me right above me knee
Up among the heather in the hills of Benifee
Mari Mac's mother's making Mari Mac marry me
My mother's making me marry Mari Mac
Well I'm going to marry Mari for when Mari's taking care of me
We'll all be feeling merry when I marry Mari Mac
Well I said "Wee bonnie lassie, where you going to spend the day?"
She said "Among the heather in the hills of Benifee"
Where all the boys and girls are making out so free
Up among the heather in the hills of Benifee
Mari Mac's mother's making Mari Mac marry me
My mother's making me marry Mari Mac
Well I'm going to marry Mari for when Mari's taking care of me
We'll all be feeling merry when I marry Mari Mac
The wedding's on Wednesday, everything's arranged
Soon her name will be changed to mine unless her mind be changed
And making the arrangements, I'm feeling quite deranged
Marriage is an awful undertaking
Mari Mac's mother's making Mari Mac marry me
My mother's making me marry Mari Mac
Well I'm going to marry Mari for when Mari's taking care of me
We'll all be feeling merry when I marry Mari Mac
Sure to be a grand affair, grander than a fair
Going to be a fork and plate for every man that's there
And I'll be a bugger if I don't get my share
If I don't we'll be very much mistaken
Mari Mac's mother's making Mari Mac marry me
My mother's making me marry Mari Mac
Well I'm going to marry Mari for when Mari's taking care of me
We'll all be feeling merry when I marry Mari Mac
There's a neat little lass and her name is Mari Mac
Make no mistake, she's the girl I'm gonna track
Lot of other fellas try to get up on her back
I'm thinking that they'll have to get up early
Mari Mac's mother's making Mari Mac marry me
My mother's making me marry Mari Mac
Well I'm going to marry Mari for when Mari's taking care of me
We'll all be feeling merry when I marry Mari Mac

Cheeseburger In Paradise~
Tried to amend my carnivorous habits
Made it nearly seventy days
Losin' weight without speed, eatin' sunflower seeds
Drinkin' lots of carrot juice and soakin' up rays
But at night I'd have these wonderful dreams
Some kind of sensuous treat
Not zucchini, fettucini, or bulgar wheat
But a big warm bun and a huge hunk of meat
Cheeseburger in paradise
Heaven on earth with an onion slice
Not too particular, not too precise
I'm just a cheeseburger in paradise
Heard about the oldtime sailor men
They eat the same thing again and again
Warm beer and bread they said could raise the dead
Well, it reminds me of the menu at a Holiday Inn
But times've changed for sailors these days
When I'm in port I get what I need
Not just Havanas or bananas or daiquiris
But that American creation on which I feed!
Cheeseburger in paradise
Medium rare with mustard'd be nice
Heaven on earth with an onion slice
I'm just a cheeseburger in paradise
I like mine with lettuce and tomato
Heinz 57 and french fried potatoes
Big kosher pickle and a cold draft beer
Well, good god Almighty which way do I steer
For a cheeseburger in paradise
Makin' the best of every virtue and vice
Worth every damn bit of sacrifice
To get a cheeseburger in paradise
To be a cheeseburger in paradise
I'm just a cheeseburger in paradise

Math Suks~
If necessity is the mother of invention
Then I'd like to kill the guy who invented this
The numbers come together in some kind of a third dimension
A regular algebraic bliss
Let's start with something simple, like one and one ain't three
And two plus two will never get you five
There are fractions in my subtraction and x don't equal y
But my homework is bound to multiply
Math suks math suks
I'd like to burn this textbook, I hate this stuff so much
Math suks math suks
Sometimes I think that I don't know that much
But math suks
I got so bored with my homework, I turned on the TV.
The beauty contest winners were all smiling through their teeth
Then they asked the new Miss America
Hey babe can you add up all those bucks?
She looked puzzled, then just said
"Math Suks"
Math suks math suks
You don't even have to spell it
All you have to do is yell it
Math suks math suks
Sometime times I think that I don't know that much
But math suks
Geometry, trigonometry and if that don't tax your brain
There are numbers too big to be named
Numerical precision is a science with a mission
And I think it's gonna drive me insane
Parents fighting with their children, and the Congress can't agree
Teachers and their students are all jousting constantly.
Management and labor keep rattling old sabers
Quacking like those Peabody ducks.
Math suks, quack quack
Math suks, quack quack
You don't even have to spell it
All you have to do is yell it!
Math suks math suks
Sometimes I think that I don't know that much
But math suks!
Math suks, math suks, math suks the big one
Math suks, math suks, math suks the big one
Math, big bad math
Math suks, math suks, math suks the big one

Blue Rodeo~
Hasn't Hit Me Yet~
You say that you're leving
Well that comes as no surprise
Still I kinda like this feeling
Of being left behind
This ain't nothing new to me
Well its just like going home
It's kinda like those sunsets
That leave you feeling so stoned
Hey hey I guess it hasn't hit me yet
I fell through this crack
And I kinda lost my head
I stand transfixed before this street light
Watching the snow fall on this cold December night
I never thought this could happen
But somehow the feeling is gone
You got sick of the patterns
And I got lost in this song
Hey hey I guess it hasn't hit me yet
I fell though crack
And I kinda lost my head
I stand transfixed before this street light
Watching the snow flal on this cold December night
And out in the middle of lake Ontario
The same snow is falling
On the deep silent water
The great dark wonder
Into the waves of my heart
Into the waves of my heart
